# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation.  Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping. 

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those **scores** is at least +0.5.

### Environment Setup

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P3/Tennis/Tennis_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p3_collab-compet/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

3. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```

4. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py#install-mujoco) to install mujoco, make sure to install version 1.5.0

5. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).

6. Clone the [DRLND GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
    cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
    pip install .
    ```
    - If you encounter with torch installation error, install version 0.4.0 with following command first:
        ```bash
        pip install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
        ```
    - If you encounter with tensorflow installation error, install version 1.7.1 with following command first:
        ```bash
        pip install tensorflow==1.7.1
        ```

7. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
    ```bash
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
    ```

8. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu. 

9. Install gym environment
    - Run those lines before installation
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
    sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3
    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install -y patchelf
    ```
    - Download mujoco from [this link](https://www.roboti.us/download/mjpro150_linux.zip)
    - Copy mujoco content to ~/.mujoco
    - Copy mujoco license mjkey.txt to mujoco path ~/.mujoco
    - Add following line to .bashrc
    ```bash
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/travisz/.mujoco/mjpro150/bin
    ```
    - install gym with following line
    ```bash
    pip3 install gym[all]
    ```

10. (Optional) After all those steps, you can reinstall torch with latest version to access latest features & functionalities like Flatten()


### Training

- You can simply run all cells of the notebook to begin training. There are two cells that are different modes of training:
    - DDPG
    - DDPG + Prioritized Experience replay
- The results of each training mode is indicated below each cell, with score printed for every episode and plot of average score vs score per episode, and actor/critic models saved in each result folder(e.g. /ddpg_result_date/)
- The detailed report is in DDPG report.pdf
